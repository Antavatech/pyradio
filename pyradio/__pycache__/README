This directory is here for pep 517 integration...
Depending on the build system, it may cause problems.
For example:

1. on Acch Linux this will cause the build to fail
   Solution: the directory is deleted before build

2. On other Linux distros (Gentoo, for example) and MacOs
   it will heve to be present

3. There is this README file in the directory; if this
   causes any problems, just remove the README file
   before build
