## MPV installation

Go to [MPV's home](http://mpv.io) and open the [Installation](https://mpv.io/installation) page and click the [Windows builds by shinchiro (releases and git)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpv-player-windows/files) link to get to the files. Then you can choose to install either the git version ([64bit](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpv-player-windows/files/64bit/) or [32bit](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpv-player-windows/files/32bit/)), or the latest **stable** [release](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpv-player-windows/files/release/) which also provides both 64 and 32 bit binaries.

**Note:** I am stating here all the links, although all one has to do is get to the last one and download the **MPV setup**. This is done so that in case any of the links change in the future, the way to go will be known, having [MPV's home page](https://mpv.io) as a starting point.

You will end up downloading a [7z archive](https://www.7-zip.org/), which contains a directory whose name is similar to **mpv-0.34.-x86_64.7z**.

Extract this archive to whatever place you like and **rename** it to **mpv**.

Here comes the tricky part...

Move the **mpv** directory to either on of the following locations:

a. **%USERPROFILE%**

    This is actually your "*Home*" directory.

    Please make a note that you will add "**%USERPROFILE%\\mpv** to PATH.

b. **%APPDATA%\\pyradio**

    This is (or will be) "*PyRadio's configuration directory*".

    In case the **pyradio** directory does not exit, you just go ahead and create it.

    (Make a note that you will add "**%APPDATA%\\pyradio\\mpv** to PATH)

In either case, in order to do that, open an **Explorer File Manager** window, and enter at its location field **%USERPROFILE%** or **%APPDATA%**.

If you are unsure on how to do that, please refer to the following image (you can ENTER **%USERPROFILE%** or **%APPDATA%** or any other Windows System Variable this way).

## Adding MPV to the PATH

The final step is to add MPV to the PATH System Variable.

Now, you already know the **path string** that has to be added (you have made a note of it in the previous step).

There's just one thing to say here: Windows provide a "*User variable for User*" and a "*System variables*" section in the "*Environment Variables*" window.

Add the **path string** to the "*User variables for User*" section.

In order to make the actual addition, please refer to the following image.

**Note**: This image is the one used in the relevant **mplayer** page; in this case you just replace **mplayer** with **mpv**.

After applying the changes you should **log off and back on** or **restart the system**, because changes done to the PATH variable will take effect the next time you log into the system.

When you are back on, verify that you can run **MPV**; open a console (press the **Win** key, type **cmd** and press **ENTER**) and type "**mpv**".

If you get something similar to the following snippet, you are all good.
